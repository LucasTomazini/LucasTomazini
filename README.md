### Hello, My name is Lucas Tomazini ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with two years of experience in the field. I have developed expertise in data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

My code mainly uses Python and its libraries/frameworks to develop data-driven solutions for different kinds of problems. For my master's degree, I am currently working with some variations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to create industrial solutions.
